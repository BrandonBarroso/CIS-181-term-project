## Introduction
This is a pet setting website busienss website, based off a real local business in the chicago area. Made using HTML, CSS, and also images from online resources. This is the completed project as of May 10, 2025. 

## Features

- Home (A landing page that catches the user’s attention, it should make the user
interested in the services offered, it should also have an FAQ section to answer
common questions)
- About us (A page about the owner and talking about why they are interested in doing
pet services as well as some background on them)
- Services (A page listing all the standard services of the business as well as their
cost. Special seasonal services should go under promotions)
- Contact (A standard contact page with email, phone, etc. each of those contact
methods should allow the user to easily send an email or call)
- Promotions (A page to promote special deals such as maybe ‘a photo with santo’
for pets around Christmas time, or maybe a summer pool day for their pet)
- Testimonials (A page that would show images of different dogs / cats which were
pets that were taken care of. This page can also be a bit humorous with the pet being
the one giving the testimonial)
